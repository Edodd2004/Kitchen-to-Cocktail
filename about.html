  <h1>ABOUT</h1>
  <div class="about-heading-line"></div>
  <p>Hey, I'm Ted a university student and a beginner bartender.</p>

<p>My aim with this website is to share the knowledge I discover along the way about mixology and to offer a drinking experience that caters to all demographics.</p>

      <h2>My Background</h2>
       <div class="about-heading-line"></div>
     <p>Hey Iâ€™m Ted and I am a university student as well as a new bartender.</p>

<p>My local bar was looking for staff and I decided to take the job because I needed some work. At first it was just a way to earn some money but over time I became really interested in the craft. The more I learned about mixing drinks and creating a great atmosphere the more I fell in love with mixology.</p>

<p>Outside of bartending and studying you will usually find me enjoying football or tennis. This website is my way of sharing everything I am learning along the way from recipes and techniques to stories from behind the bar.</p>

<p>Thanks for stopping by and I hope you enjoy the site.</p>

     <p>Kitchen to Cocktails is designed for everyone. Whether you are dieting at the gym and want lower-calorie options, preing at uni (and as a student I know how rough some of those drinks can be), or even a non-drinker looking for tasty alternatives, this site has you covered.</p>

<p>My aim is to help you learn mixology from home using the right equipment and ingredients. From easy, affordable drinks to more refined cocktails, Kitchen to Cocktails offers something for all tastes and lifestyles.</p>
